# My Digital Canvas

This repository contains the source code for my first personal portfolio website. It serves as a comprehensive showcase of my skills, projects, experiences, and more.
I delve into the world of CSS, HTML and JavaScript.

**This project utilizes:**

* **HTML:** For structuring the content and layout of the website.
* **CSS:** For styling the visual appearance, including responsiveness and aesthetics.
* **JavaScript:** For adding interactivity, dynamic features, and enhancing the user experience.

**Purpose:**

This website is my initial step into creating an online presence to showcase my web development abilities. As my first personal portfolio, it's designed to be a foundational platform where I can present who I am, what I'm learning, and the projects I'm working on. My goal is to build a comprehensive and up-to-date representation of my skills and progress.

**Key Features (Anticipated - will be updated as development progresses):**

* **About Me:** A detailed introduction highlighting my background, skills, and interests.
* **Portfolio/Projects:** A showcase of my web development projects, potentially including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or GitHub repositories.
* **Skills:** A clear overview of my technical proficiencies in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* **Experience:** Details about my professional history, education, and any relevant experiences.
* **Contact Information:** Easy ways for visitors to get in touch with me.
* **[Potentially other sections based on your content, e.g., Blog, Resume, Services]**
